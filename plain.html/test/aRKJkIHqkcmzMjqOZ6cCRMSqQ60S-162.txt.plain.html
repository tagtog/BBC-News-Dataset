          <pre id="s1v1">howard s unfinished business  he s not finished yet   whispered the conservative party person as your reporter attempted to slip quietly from the hall. and indeed he wasn t. michael howard had already broken away from the printed text of his speech  at his party s spring conference in brighton  to deliver a smart rebuff to peter hain s description of him as an  attack mongrel   claiming such personal abuse meant labour was  rattled  by the tory challenge. and here he was again  moving to the front of the stage as the party faithful rose to their feet in applause  to make a personal  ad-libbed appeal to them to go out and fight for victory.  one day you will be able to tell your children and grandchildren as i will tell mine   i was there. i did my bit. i played my part. i helped to win that famous election - the election that transformed our country for the better .  the speech  which was peppered with references to mr howard s humble beginnings as the  child of immigrants   had been introduced by his son nick  a trainee vicar  who praised his father s honesty.  i always know where i am with him because all my life he has meant what he has said to me   he said. mr howard was also joined on stage by his wife sandra  daughter larissa and stepson sholto.  the audience s reaction to all of this was a little muted by party conference standards.  but mr howard s overall message - that the tories have labour on the run and that they can win the next election - did not sound quite as hollow as it might have done six months ago. mr howard claimed  with some justification  that the tories  campaign has got off to a  great start . they have had labour on the back foot over immigration  with tony blair hastily adding a sixth promise on the issue to his latest pledge card  and have even managed to score points in traditional labour territory such as health and education. the stunts involving margaret dixon with her postponed operation and maria hutchings with concerns about her son s special needs education may not have been to everyone s taste  but they succeeded in bringing the issues alive and forcing labour to react. senior tories believe they are  at long last  starting to tap into the public mood  cutting through the background noise to connect with the ordinary voter. their latest poster campaign flags up a range of policies from better school discipline  cleaner hospitals ( i mean  how hard is it to keep a hospital clean  ) and immigration ( it s not racist to impose limits on immigration ) - under the headline  are you thinking what we are thinking   this  they say  contrasts with labour s negative campaigning  such as its now infamous  flying pigs  poster.  oliver letwin  one of the men lampooned in the labour poster  affects bewilderment at what he believes is labour s loss of its once sure footing on the campaign trail. the peter hain  mongrel  attack  he says  is just the latest example of the party getting the tone wrong - a by-product  he claims  of the tories setting the agenda.   i have to say i don t understand what they are doing. the labour machine appears to be in some kind of state of shock  it doesn t seem to know what to do.  a few weeks of positive headlines have also done wonders for tory activists  morale - likely to be a crucial factor at an election which  most analysts seem to agree  will hinge on which party can get their core support out.  it has been a fantastic few weeks   said 20-year-old politics student nick vaughan.  our policies have been getting in the media and there is a sense that we can win. i wouldn t be here if i didn t think we could.  some delegates even spoke of the next election being like 1970  when ted heath  behind in the polls and written off by the pundits  snatched victory from harold wilson s labour party.  they all insisted it was not going to be a re-run of 2001.  we thought in 2001 we were going to dent that massive majority but it just didn t happen   said john murray  of aldridge browhills conservatives.  it was very disappointing. this time it really is different.  whoever is running our strategy from the top has got it bang on. blair is on the back foot.  much of the credit for the tories  recent change of fortune must go to lynton crosby  the australian strategist who succeeded in turning political veteran and apparent no-hoper john howard  of australia s liberal party  into a serial election winner. the tories still have a mountain climb if michael howard is to walk through the doors of number 10. even allowing for the natural bias against the tories in some opinion polls  they are still behind  when to have a chance of overturning labour s whopping majority  they should really be ahead. but as they gear up for the start of the campaign proper  the party at least has reason to hope that  like his australian namesake  mr howard really isn t finished yet.</pre>
