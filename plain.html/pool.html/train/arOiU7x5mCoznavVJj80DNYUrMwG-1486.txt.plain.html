          <pre id="s1v1">few ready  for information act thousands of public bodies are ill-prepared for the freedom of information act  due to come into force next month  because of government failures  say mps.  from next month anyone will have the power to demand information from a range of public bodies - from whitehall departments to doctors  surgeries. but an all-party committee said it was  not confident  many would be ready. it blamed the department for constitutional affairs for a  lack of consistent leadership .  the act comes into effect in england  wales and northern ireland  on 1 january while similar measures are being brought in at the same time in scotland. it provides the public with a right of access to information held by about 100 000 public bodies  subject to various exemptions.  but the government department responsible for implementing the change suffered from an  unusually high turnover  of staff within the department  which had  seriously interfered  with its work  said the constitutional affairs select committee. it said  despite four years of preparations  some local authorities and parts of the health sector were still not ready. the dca had  failed  to provide early guidance on technical matters and shown a  lack of consistent leadership   the mps found. committee chairman alan beith said:  the dca has had four years to prepare for freedom of information  but with less than a month to go it appears that some bodies may not be well enough prepared.  our report shows that in the past support and guidance from the dca  which has overall responsibility for guiding the public sector through the process of implementation for the freedom of information regime  has been lacking.  a spokesman for the dca said:  the dca has provided - and will continue to provide - strong  clear leadership.  it has delivered a simple  liberal fees regime  guidance on the act which has been widely praised  and expert networks of staff working on freedom of information implementation.</pre>
