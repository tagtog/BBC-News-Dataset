          <pre id="s1v1">cairn shares slump on oil setback shares in cairn energy  a uk oil firm  have closed down 18% after a disappointing drilling update and a warning over possible tax demands.  the company said tests had shown no significant finds in one of its indian oil fields  but was upbeat about the potential of other areas. it also said the indian government had told it to pay a production tax  for which cairn argues it is not liable. cairn s shares have jumped by almost 400% this year. investors had piled into cairn after the company announced significant oil finds in india this year. chief executive bill gammell said on friday he was  disappointed  with exploration in the so-called n-c extension area in rajasthan. investors had held high hopes of major oil finds in this area. but cairn said estimates had been revised in what was a  significant downgrade of the initial expectation .  cairn also said that the government believed the company was liable to pay taxes under its production-sharing contract. the company said the rate would be about 900 rupees ($20.40; Â£10.50) per tonne  or seven barrels  of oil. a spokesman for the firm said that the tax would wipe 5% of the field s current value.   cairn refutes the government s position   mr gammell said. he insisted that the contract made it clear that the tax should be shouldered by the licensee - india s state-run oil &amp; natural gas corp (ongc) - and not the contractor.  we have a pretty strong legal case here   he added  saying it would only become an issue once the firm started production. investors took a dim view of the statements though. the shares closed down 247p  or 18%  at 1115 pence.  i think people were slightly over-ambitious for how quickly cairn would be able to develop and potentially offload these reserves   said analyst jason kenney at ing.  the disappointments overshadowed increased production targets for cairn s existing oilfields. the company raised targets for its mangala and aishwariya fields in india from 60 000 barrels a day to between 80 000 and 100 000 barrels a day. its mangala field  thought to contain a billion barrels  is its biggest find to date.  these two fields will provide the core of the future developments in rajasthan   mr gammell said. cairn added that it would be appraising another field early next year. mr gammell set up the company in the 1980s and has successfully switched its focus to south asia from interests in the us and europe. cairn  which also operates in nepal and bangladesh  was catapulted into the ftse 100 index of leading uk shares earlier this year after the sharp rise in its share price.</pre>
