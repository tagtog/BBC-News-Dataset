          <pre id="s1v1">clarke plans migrant point scheme anyone planning to move to the uk will have to pass a test to prove they can contribute to the country  home secretary charles clarke has said.  he is proposing a points system similar to australia s but would avoid the quota system planned by the tories. mr clarke  who will unveil his plans on monday  said economic migration helped the uk but  needed proper policing . the lib dems say they will look at his plans  but tory liam fox said his party offered a  clear choice  on the issue. the conservative party co-chairman said the british electorate had a choice between a labour government that had  done nothing for eight years and will not set a limit  on immigration and a tory one that would impose quotas.  the home secretary said  by 2008  he wanted everyone given a visa and entering the uk to have their fingerprints taken  to  ensure we can know everybody who is in the country . speaking on bbc one s breakfast with frost  he said  economic migrants are of great value to this country   but stressed that proper policing was needed to ensure that they do not become a  burden on society . he said:  we will establish a system ... which looks at the skills  talents and abilities of people seeking to come and work in this country  and ensures that when they come here they have a job and can contribute to the economy of the country.   the home secretary  whose five-year blueprint for immigration and asylum is expected to be published on monday  also rejected claims that the immigration debate encouraged bigotry.  the issue of who does come into this country  and whether they are entitled to be in this country  who does settle here  how we have border controls  is a perfectly legitimate aspect of public debate   he said. liberal democrat home affairs spokesman mark oaten said:  whilst it is good that labour has rejected the tory idea of quotas on asylum  the jury is still out on the home office s ability to deliver a fair and efficient asylum system.   mr howard has said britain should take its fair share of the world s  genuine refugees . but he claims the current asylum system is being abused - and with it britain s generosity. trevor phillips  chairman of the commission for racial equality  called on mr clarke to denounce the suggestion britain s hospitality was being tested by immigration.  tell that to the 44 000 doctors in the nhs and the 70 000 nurses without whom we would really see what pressure on the health service means   he said.  ditto the teachers  from south africa  australia  jamaica  who are reducing the sizes of our classes and schools.  the refugee council said mr howard s proposals would mean there would be no safe haven in the uk.</pre>
