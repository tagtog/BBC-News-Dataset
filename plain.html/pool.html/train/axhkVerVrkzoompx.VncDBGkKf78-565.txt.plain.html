          <pre id="s1v1">dawson set for new wasps contract european champions wasps are set to offer matt dawson a new deal.  the 31-year-old world cup winning scrum-half has impressed since joining the london side from northampton this summer on a one-year contract. wasps coach warren gatland told the daily mirror:  we have not yet offered matt a new contract but we will be doing so.  i m very happy with his contribution and i think he s good enough to play for another couple of years.  dawson played a vital part in england s world cup win last year but has fallen out of favour with new coach andy robinson after missing a training session in september. however he hopes the new deal will help him regain his england place.   rugby is still my priority and there s still a burning desire within me to play the best rugby i possibly can   he said.  i know within myself  if i was given the chance i could play for england again.  i know i m fit enough  i m strong enough  i m skilful enough.</pre>
