          <pre id="s1v1">dame julie pops in to see poppins mary poppins star dame julie andrews watched the hit stage version of her classic film at a charity performance in london s west end.  it was the first time dame julie  who shot to fame as the nanny in the 1964 disney movie  had seen the musical  staged at the prince edward theatre. she watched laura michelle kelly  23  reprise the role on stage. the show has been one of the west end s hottest tickets since opening in december  winning two olivier awards. kelly was named best musical actress at last month s ceremony and the musical also won best choreography.  but kelly said she was  very nervous  about meeting dame julie because she was  my absolute hero . the gala performance saw dame julie  69  return to the theatre where she had her first starring role in a performance of humpty dumpty in 1948. the mary poppins musical has been masterminded by theatre impresario sir cameron mackintosh and directed by richard eyre with choreography by matthew bourne. sir cameron said he hoped the production  which cost Â£9m to bring to the stage  was a blend of the sweet-natured film and the original book by pl travers. proceeds from thursday s show will go to charities including absolute return for kids (ark)  international relief agency operation usa and drama school lamda.</pre>
