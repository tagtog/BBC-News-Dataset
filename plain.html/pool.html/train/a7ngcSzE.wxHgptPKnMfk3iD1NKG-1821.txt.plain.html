          <pre id="s1v1">johnny and denise lose passport johnny vaughan and denise van outen s saturday night entertainment show passport to paradise will not return to screens  the bbc has said.  the ex-big breakfast presenters were recruited to host the bbc one family variety show last july.  there are currently no plans for another series   a spokeswoman said. she added the pair  brought a real warmth to saturday night  but in the end we felt we had done enough with the format of the show .  passport to paradise involved a combination of games and outside broadcasts with a high level of audience participation. the first instalment attracted more than 4.1 million viewers - but that had dropped to fewer than 2.7 million by the time it ended. the bbc spokeswoman said graham norton s strictly dance fever would be a priority for 2005.  that s very much on the cards for next year  and we re concentrating at the moment on strictly come dancing  which is doing phenomenally well   she said.</pre>
