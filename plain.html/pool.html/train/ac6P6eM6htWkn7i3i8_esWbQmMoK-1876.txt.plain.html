          <pre id="s1v1">oscars race enters final furlong the race for the oscars entered its final stages as the deadline for voters to choose their winners passed.  the 5 808 academy voters had until tuesday afternoon to return their ballots - any late submissions will not be included in the count. the next five days will be spent counting the voting forms and preparing the winners  envelopes. best actor nominee leonardo dicaprio is to present a statuette for the first time at the la ceremony on sunday.  the 30-year-old actor  who is nominated for playing howard hughes in the aviator  will join other hopefuls such as co-star cate blanchett  natalie portman and kate winslet as oscar presenters. the only people who will know the oscar winners before they are revealed at the ceremony will be the auditors who are in charge of looking after the ballot count.  after collating the results  they are responsible for sealing the results in the famous golden envelopes which will be revealed by a host of celebrity presenters at the ceremony. former academy award winners gwyneth paltrow  dustin hoffman and halle berry will also present prizes. the event at the kodak theatre will be attended by 3 300 people  including some of the best-known names in film  and organisers say they expect it will be watched on television by one billion people around the world. one current concern is the torrential rain which has lashed los angeles for the past week  flooding suburbs and causing mudslides. it is hoped the forecast for sunday  for cool weather but no rain  will prove accurate.  the last time it rained on oscars night was in the mid-to-late 1980s   said oscars communications director john pavlik.  we have had rain up until the day before the show many times  but for some reason the oscar gods always shine on sunday and we hope they will do so again this year   he added.</pre>
