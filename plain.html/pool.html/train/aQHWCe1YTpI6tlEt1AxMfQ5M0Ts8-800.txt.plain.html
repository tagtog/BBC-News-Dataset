          <pre id="s1v1">godzilla gets hollywood fame star movie monster godzilla has received a star on hollywood s walk of fame  honouring both his 50th birthday and the launch of his 28th film.  an actor dressed as the giant creature breathed smoke over photographers on monday as godzilla received the 2 271st star on hollywood boulevard.  godzilla should thank you for this historical and monumental star   said final wars producer shogo tomiyama.  but unfortunately  he cannot speak english   he added. hollywood s honorary mayor  johnny grant  said:  i do hereby proclaim this godzilla day in hollywood.   he s loose  he s wild  and i m getting the hell out of here   he added. the premiere of godzilla: final wars at grauman s chinese theatre followed the ceremony on hollywood boulevard. the monster was joined by co-stars including japanese pop star and actor masahiro matsuoka. director ryuhei kitamura said it may not be godzilla s final outing  as it has been billed.  that s what the producers say. but the producer s a liar   he said.  [godzilla s] been working for the last 50 years. so  i think godzilla just deserves a vacation.  and producer shogo tomiyama added:  so long as godzilla can fascinate people  i believe he will be resurrected by new generations of filmmakers in the future.  godzilla first appeared in 1954 as a prehistoric lizard woken by atomic bomb tests.</pre>
