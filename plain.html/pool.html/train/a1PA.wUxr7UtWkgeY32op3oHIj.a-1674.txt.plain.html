          <pre id="s1v1">mogul wilson backing uk rap band tony wilson  the music mogul who established the influential factory records in the 1980s  is to launch a new label - convinced he has discovered his  third major band .  factory were the label of both joy division - who became new order after singer ian curtis committed suicide - and the happy mondays. now wilson believes rap act raw t - signed to his f4 label  the fourth incarnation of factory - will  complete the hat-trick .  suddenly  when raw t came into my life  i realised they are my third major band   he told bbc world service s the music biz programme. the group are set to release their first single on 21 february  and follow it up with an album  realise and witness  in march.  wilson has twice tried to resurrect factory - which lasted for 14 years before folding - but conceded these efforts had been  despondent and dismal experiences . but it has not put him off.  of all the things i do in my life the most exciting thing i ve ever done  and the thing i have most loved  is being part of a record company   he added.   the idea of working with brilliant young musicians  and being close to the centre of popular culture  is just the biggest thrill in my life.  wilson explained how his son persuaded him to go and see raw t  but he had initially been reluctant saying he  detested  young british people rapping.  it s always inauthentic  it s always crass  it never really works for me   he said.  i went to see this group  raw t - which stands for realise and witness talent - and like everyone else in the room that night  we were utterly blown away.  wilson believes raw t could be  to f4 as joy division were to factory records .  the story of factory records - which also owned the legendary hacienda club in manchester - was told in the michael winterbottom film 24 hour party people  in which wilson was played by steve coogan.  wilson stressed that the independent music scene remained  as important  as it had been during the 1980s  when labels such as factory and rough trade proliferated. he pointed out that franz ferdinand and the white stripes -  perhaps the two most important bands since the millennium  - were signed to indies.  i think that is a reflection of how useful and how powerful the indie philosophy is  and how bands prefer it   he added.  they can make more money that way - it s a more generous relationship  and also it s a more understanding relationship.  i think independents are in a wonderful position at this moment in time.</pre>
