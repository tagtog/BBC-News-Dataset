          <pre id="s1v1">britannia members  £42m windfall more than 800 000 britannia building society members are to receive a profit share worth on average £52 each.  members of the uk s second largest building society will share £42m  with 100 000 receiving a windfall of more than £100. depending on how much they borrow or invest  members earn  reward  points which entitle them to a share of the society s profits. the payouts are bigger than last year  because of stricter eligibility rules. last year  britannia members shared £42m  but the average payment was only £38.  to qualify for this year s payment  customers must have been members for at least two years on 31 december 2004. britannia has also stopped making payments to members if they are worth less than £5.  to qualify for the profit share  members must have either a mortgage  or an investment account other than a deposit account. customers can also qualify if they have permanent interest bearing shares (pibs). the profit share scheme was introduced in 1997 and has paid out more than £370m. britannia will unveil its results on wednesday.</pre>
