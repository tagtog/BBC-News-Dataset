          <pre id="s1v1">net regulation  still possible  the blurring of boundaries between tv and the internet raises questions of regulation  watchdog ofcom has said.  content on tv and the internet is set to move closer this year as tv-quality video online becomes a norm. at a debate in westminster  the net industry considered the options. lord currie  chairman of super-regulator ofcom  told the panel that protecting audiences would always have to be a primary concern for the watchdog. despite having no remit for the regulation of net content  disquiet has increased among internet service providers as speeches made by ofcom in recent months hinted that regulation might be an option. at the debate  organised by the internet service providers  association (ispa)  lord currie did not rule out the possibility of regulation.   the challenge will arise when boundaries between tv and the internet truly blur and then there is a balance to be struck between protecting consumers and allowing them to assess the risks themselves   he said. adopting the rules that currently exist to regulate tv content or self-regulation  which is currently the practice of the net industry  will be up for discussion.  some studies suggest that as many as eight million households in the uk could have adopted broadband by the end of 2005  and the technology opens the door to tv content delivered over the net. more and more internet service providers and media companies are streaming video content on the web. bt has already set up an entertainment division to create and distribute content that could come from sources such as bskyb  itv and the bbc. head of the division  andrew burke  spoke about the possibility of creating content for all platforms.  how risque can i be in this new age  with celebrity chefs serving up more expletives than hot dinners  surely i can push it to the limit   he said.  in fact  he said  if content has been requested by consumers and they have gone to lengths to download it  then maybe it should be entirely regulation free. internet service providers have long claimed no responsibility for the content they carry on their servers since the law commission dubbed them  mere conduits  back in 2002. this defence does not apply if they have actual knowledge of illegal content and have failed to remove it. the level of responsibility they have has been tested in several high-profile legal cases. richard ayers  portal director at tiscali  said there was little point trying to regulate the internet because it would be impossible. huge changes are afoot in 2005  he predicted  as companies such as the bbc offer tv content over the net. the bbc s planned interactive media player which will give surfers the chance to download programmes such as eastenders and top gear will make net tv mainstream and raise a whole new set of questions  he said.  one of these will be about the vast sums of money involved in maintaining the network to supply such a huge quantity of data and could herald a new digital licence fee  said mr ayers. as inappropriate net content  most obviously pornography viewed by children  continues to dominate the headlines  internet regulation remains a political issue said mp richard allan  liberal democrat spokesman on it. mr allan thinks that the answer could lie somewhere between the cries of  impossible to regulate  and  just apply offline laws online . in fact  instead of seeing regulation brought online  the future could bring an end to regulation as we know it for all tv content. after lord currie departed  the panel agreed that this could be a reality and that for the internet people power is likely to reign.  if content is on-demand  consumers have pulled it up rather than had pushed to them  then it is the consumers  choice to watch it. there is no watershed on the net   said mr burke.</pre>
