          <pre id="s1v1">o connor aims to grab opportunity johnny o connor is determined to make a big impression when he makes his rbs six nations debut for ireland against scotland on saturday.  the wasps flanker replaces denis leamy but o connor knows that the munster man will be pushing hard for a recall for the following game against england.  it s a  horses for courses  selection really   said o connor.  there s a lot of competition here and i can t just drag my heels around if i don t get picked.  it looks a definite head-to-head battle between himself and 23-year-old leamy - three stone heavier than o connor - for the number seven role against the world champions. nonetheless  all o connor is currently concerned about is making an impression while winning his third cap.   missing the italian game was disappointing certainly  but you can t dwell on these things - it s part and parcel of rugby.  denis has been playing really well and deserved his opportunity.  it s a good situation to be in if there are good players around you  pushing for a place in the side.  o connor  who celebrated his 25th birthday on wednesday  was touted by wasps director of rugby warren gatland as a possible 2005 lions test openside as far back as last september. and his reputation as a breakdown scavenger and heavy hitter has seen him come to the forefront of o sullivan s mind for the scottish tussle. o connor added:  it will be interesting to see how situations on the deck is reffed  with the new laws having come in.   obviously the breakdown a big part of what i do on the pitch so i m hoping to hold some influence there against what is a very solid scottish pack.  o connor will be winning his third cap after making his debut in the victory over south africa last november.</pre>
