          <pre id="s1v1">jansen suffers a further setback blackburn striker matt jansen faces three weeks out after surgery to treat a cartilage problem.  but central defender lorenzo amoruso is moving closer to fitness following a knee operation. rovers  assistant manager mark bowen said:  matt had a small operation to trim knee cartilage.  it s a tiny piece of work  which should be a fairly quick recovery. lorenzo is also jogging for the first time  along with kicking a ball.  jansen s career has been dogged by injury since a freak scooter accident two years ago.  he returned to first-team action soon after mark hughes  appointment as blackburn boss and marked it with a goal against portsmouth in his first appearance of the season. bowen added:  i m guessing  but i reckon maybe two to three weeks before he is back in action completely.  the rovers assistant boss forecast a longer time spell for amoruso s availability for first-team duties. bowen said:  there s still some scar tissue present so it will be some weeks.  it s a case of see how he goes. you can t put a real time on a comeback  we ll see how he progresses.</pre>
