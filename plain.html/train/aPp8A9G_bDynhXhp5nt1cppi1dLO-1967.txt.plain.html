          <pre id="s1v1">kuznetsova  failed a drugs test  us open champion svetlana kuznetsova has tested positive for a banned drug  according to belgian authorities.  belgian sports minister claude eerdekens said that the russian world number five tested positive for the stimulant ephedrine on 19 december. kuznetsova was playing in an exhibition event in charleroi at the time. eerdekens said:  there is a problem. ephedrine was discovered. she remains innocent until proved guilty. she can ask for it to be tested again.  the situation remains unclear as the tournament was not commissioned by the world anti-doping agency (wada)  the international tennis federation (itf) or the women s tennis accosiation (wta). the test was carried out by regional belgian authorities and kuznetsova has not yet been able to have a b sample tested.  speaking at the australian open on monday  before eerdekens identified her  kuznetsova said:  i m not worried. i m not using anything to push myself.  i have not been notified of any positive test  and i think it is unfair that it s come out the way it did.  eerdekens said that confirmation of the findings was sent last friday to the player s address in spain  as well as to the belgian prosecutors  office and the belgian and russian tennis federations. he conceded kuznetsova might have taken a medicine which contained the banned substance.  we have simply stated a fact   he said.  it is for the federation concerned to impose the disciplinary measures after a procedure that respects the defence.   either the ephedrine was taken to improve her performance or it is because she took some medicine legitimately to cure an infection.  however  kuznetsova s naming was condemned by russian tennis chief shamil tarpishchev.  first of all  this belgian sports minister has broken every ethical rule in the book by naming a player without any proof of wrongdoing  without any basic evidence   tarpishchev said.  we all know the basic principle in doping cases. if there is a positive sample  then they should notify the international tennis federation (itf) as well as the national federation within three days   he said.  this is not the case here. as of today we have not received any statement from the doping officials  nor did the itf.  today i called the itf headquarters and they told me they know nothing about it.  if wada (the world anti-doping agency) was behind the testing  then we would also have known something by now.  otherwise  all these looks to me as pure fiction and fabrication of the facts.</pre>
