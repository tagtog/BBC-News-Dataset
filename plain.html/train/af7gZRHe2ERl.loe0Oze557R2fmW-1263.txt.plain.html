          <pre id="s1v1">defiant hunts put ban to the test thousands of hunt supporters have been out on the first day of hunting in england and wales after the ban on hunting with dogs came into force.  the countryside alliance called on hunt supporters to meet as normal  but vowed to stay within the law. although hunting with dogs is now a criminal offence  exercising hounds  chasing a scent trail and flushing out foxes to be shot are still legal. one anti-hunt protester was taken to hospital after a violent clash in kent.  the man suffered facial injuries after an incident involving a group of men at the end of the east kent hunt  near ashford. in wiltshire  police arrested four men under the new law suspected of hunting with dogs. the group  from south wales and ireland  have been released on bail but police say they may face prosecution under new poaching laws.  it is believed more than 270 hunts went out on saturday  just one day after the ban came in.  they were greeted by big crowds in many areas of the country  with actor jeremy irons and former minister kate hoey among the supporters. anti-hunt groups - such as the league against cruel sports - deployed 100 monitors at hunts to check for illegal activity.  mike hobday  from the league  said video evidence of the law being broken was to be passed onto police.  our evidence suggests that most hunts did operate within the law  many meeting and promptly going home and others peacefully exercising their hounds or drag hunting.  however  we have received reports of what we believe is clearly illegal activity by a number of hunts across britain.  bbc correspondent simon hall at postbridge on dartmoor in the west country said 2 000 people had turned out to welcome the hunt.  and the bbc s sarah mukherjee  with the beaufort hunt in badminton  gloucestershire said several hundred people had gathered on foot to see the hunt  with 150 on horseback. tom heap  bbc rural affairs correspondent  said it appeared that hunstman had  for now  been sticking to the new rules. and while there was big turnout in support of the hunts on saturday  he said it remains to be seen if the level of backing can be maintained.  before riding out with the hunt  former minister kate hoey told crowds:  we will prevail and this law will have to be overturned.  judith moritz  in melton mowbray  said anti-hunt activists were out to monitor the four hunts operating in that part of leicestershire  but were outnumbered by large crowds of followers. the countryside alliance said the meets would show the new law was  impossibly difficult to determine  and open to different interpretations.  chief executive simon hart said:  there has been hunting in england for 700 years. this [ban] may take two or three years  perhaps two or three months  to unpick.  it will be nothing more than a temporary break in normal service  as broadcasters say.  conservative family spokeswoman theresa may said if the party was in government again it would make sure the law was repealed. suffolk chief constable alastair mcwhirter  the association of chief police officers  spokesman on rural policing  told the bbc the law would be enforced  although the police would not break up hunts. the attorney general lord goldsmith has so far not issued any instructions to police on how they should deal with any hunters who do violate the law. he said he would consult the director of public prosecutions and the police  in the near future  to decide what measures to take on hunting prosecutions.</pre>
