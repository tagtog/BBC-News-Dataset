          <pre id="s1v1">sales  fail to boost high street  the january sales have failed to help the uk high street recover from a poor christmas season  a survey has found.  stores received a boost from bargain hunters but trading then reverted to december levels  the british retail consortium and accountants kpmg said. sales in what is traditionally a strong month rose by 0.5% on a like-for-like basis  compared with a year earlier. consumers remain cautious over buying big-ticket items like furniture  said brc director general kevin hawkins. higher interest rates and uncertainty over the housing market continue to take their toll on the retail sector  the brc said. but clothing and footwear sales were said to be generally better than december  while department stores also had a good month.  in the three-months to january  like-for-like sales showed a growth rate of -0.1%  the same as in the three months to december  the brc said.  following a relatively strong new year s bank holiday  trading then took a downward turn   said mr hawkins.  even extending some promotions and discounts and the pay-day boost later in the month could not tempt customers.  the previous brc survey found christmas 2004 was the worst for 10 years for retailers. and according to office for national statistics data  sales in december failed to meet expectations and by some counts were the worst since 1981.</pre>
