          <pre id="s1v1">almagro continues spanish surge unseeded nicolas almagro became the fifth spaniard to reach the last eight at the buenos aires open  ousting eighth seed mariano zabaleta.  he showed admirable resolve to win a rain-affected match 6-7 6-4 6-4. compatriot and seventh seed rafael nadal also reached the last eight  beating italian potito starace 6-1 6-3. nadal  playing in the outdoor clay event for the first time  hit some powerful forehands to oust starace in a match delayed over an hour by rain.  it s always a problem to have to stop for rain but one gets used to it   said spanish teenager nadal.  luckily  i was able to keep my pace going throughout the match.  he will now play gaston gaudio  who beat unseeded brazilian flavio saretta 6-3 6-2 in the day s late match.</pre>
