          <pre id="s1v1">blair congratulates bush on win tony blair has said he looks forward to continuing his strong relationship with george bush and working with him during his second term as president.  mr bush s re-election came at a crucial time for a world that was  fractured  divided and uncertain   mr blair said. it had to be brought together  he added  saying action was needed on poverty  the middle east and the conditions on which terrorists prey. mr blair said states had to work with the us to fight global terrorism.  but there was a need to recognise it would not be defeated by  military might alone but also by demonstrating the strength of our common values  he added. solving the conflict in the middle east was the world s single most  pressing political challenge  of the present day  mr blair warned. the prime minister also urged europe and the us to  build anew their alliance .   all of us in positions of leadership  not just president bush  have a responsibility to rise to this challenge. it is urgent that we do so.  mr blair also paid tribute to democrat john kerry s campaign  saying he had helped make the presidential election  a true celebration of american democracy . the election of the us president was significant for the world but particularly so for britain because of its special relationship  he added. earlier tory leader michael howard sent mr bush his  warmest congratulations   saying:  we look to the president to be a unifying force for those all over the world who share our determination to defend freedom.  liberal democrat leader charles kennedy welcomed the fact there had been a quick conclusion to the election  unlike in 2000.  mr bush s first task was to  rebuild a sense of domestic purpose  within the us  he said. mr kennedy said:  internationally  it is to be hoped that a second term will see a more sensitive approach to relations with long-standing allies  not least for the global efforts to combat terrorism.  lib dem foreign affairs spokesman menzies campbell said a win by mr kerry would have given mr blair the chance of a fresh start  adding it was almost as if there was an  umbilical cord  between mr bush and the uk premier.   europeans must hope that his administration will be much more multilateral in character  and that he will act swiftly to rebuild the atlantic partnership which is so vital to security.  iraq will remain an issue of potential division for some time to come.  even before the result became clear  mr blair was being urged to push for action on climate change at his first meeting with whichever candidate won.  liberal democrat environment spokesman norman baker underlined the issue of global warming during a commons debate on anglo-american relations on wednesday. environment secretary margaret beckett has said the us will act on global warming despite george bush s refusal to sign up to the kyoto protocol on carbon emissions. public opinion would force change  she told bbc news. but myron ebell  an adviser on climate change to president bush  has said there would be no change in the us stance and rejected the threat of climate change. he claimed the us was the only country with independent scientists.</pre>
