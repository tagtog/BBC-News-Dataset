          <pre id="s1v1">ireland call up uncapped campbell ulster scrum-half kieran campbell is one of five uncapped players included in ireland s rbs six nations squad.  campbell is joined by ulster colleagues roger wilson and ronan mccormack along with connacht s bernard jackman and munster s shaun payne. gordon d arcy is back after injury while munster flanker alan quinlan also returns to international consideration.  the squad is selected purely on form. a lot of players put their hands up   coach eddie o sullivan told bbc sport.  kieran campbell was just one of those players. he has been playing very well in the heineken cup and deserves his call-up.  there is big competition in some departments and not so much in others. there were one or two players who were unfortunate just to miss out.  back-row forwards david wallace and victor costello are omitted  with o sullivan having quinlan  wilson  simon easterby  anthony foley  denis leamy and johnny o connor vying for the three positions.  with david humphreys  kevin maggs  simon best and tommy bowe again included  it is ulster s biggest representation in a training panel for quite some time. munster and leinster have 12 and 11 players in the squad respectively while jackman is the sole connacht representative. four british-based players are also included. ulster forward ronan mccormack said he was  totally shocked  to be included.  i m really looking forward to it   said mccormack.  i played with guys like brian o driscoll and denis hickie back in my school days in leinster so i do know a few of them although not that well.  it will be great to work with them.   s best (ulster)  s byrne (leinster)  r corrigan (leinster)  l cullen (leinster)  s easterby (llanelli)  a foley (munster)  j hayes (munster)  m horan (munster)  b jackman (connacht)  d leamy (munster)  e miller (leinster)  r mccormack (ulster)  d o callaghan (munster)  p o connell (munster)  j o connor (wasps)  m o kelly (leinster)  f sheahan (munster)  r wilson (ulster)  a quinlan (munster).  t bowe (ulster)  k campbell (ulster)  g d arcy (ulster)  g dempsey (leinster)  g duffy (harlequins)  g easterby (leinster)  d hickie (leinster)  a horgan (munster)  s horgan (leinster)  d humphreys (ulster)  k maggs (ulster)  g murphy (leicester)  b o driscoll  (leinster)  r o gara (munster)  s payne (munster)  p stringer (munster).  k gleeson (leinster)  t howe (ulster)  j kelly (munster)  n mcmillan (ulster).</pre>
