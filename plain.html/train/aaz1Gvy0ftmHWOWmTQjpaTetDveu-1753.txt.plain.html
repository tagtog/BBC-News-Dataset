          <pre id="s1v1">abba reunite for musical premiere the original stars of swedish pop quartet abba have reunited for the home premiere of hit musical mamma mia! which is based on the band s songs.  it is the first time in almost 20 years that the four  bjorn ulvaeus  benny andersson  agnetha faltskog and anni-frid lyngstad  have met publicly. faltskog has been a virtual recluse since the band split up in 1982. the musical  which has become a global phenomenon  will be performed in swedish for the first time. fans camped outside stockholm s cirkus theatre in the snow for a glimpse of the stars. the premiere marks abba s first public reunion since the legendary band s acrimonious break-up in the early 1980s. it was thought that faltskog would appear in london for the musical s fifth anniversary celebrations in april 2004 but she stayed away due to her fear of flying.  original abba member bjorn ulvaeus set about translating the musical into the band s mother tongue for the celebrated homecoming  alongside swedish artist niklas stromstedt. almost all of abba s original songs  which have sold more than 350 million records worldwide  were written and recorded in english. the musical  set on a small greek island  tells of the story of a young woman and her fiercely independent single mother. the show will include such classics as super trouper  sos and dancing queen. there are currently 14 productions being staged worldwide  including new york and london  with road shows in toronto  south korea and madrid. more than 20 million people around the world have seen the show.</pre>
